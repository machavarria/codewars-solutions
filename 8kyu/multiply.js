// Description:
// This code does not execute properly. Try to figure out why.


function multiply(a, b){
     a * b
}


// It takes in two parameters a and b
// The a * b needs to multiply
// Leaving it as is will give you an undefined
// In order to get a result back I would need to put a return


// My solution
function multiply(a, b){
    return a * b
}
