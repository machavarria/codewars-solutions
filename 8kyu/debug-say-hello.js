// Description:
// Debugging sayHello function
// The starship Enterprise has run into some problem when creating a program to greet everyone as they come aboard. It is your job to fix the code and get the program working again!

// Example output:

// Hello, Mr. Spock


// The function is supposed to say Hello to something
// Looking at the function to do that I would use a template literal and use backticks for it 



// My solution
function sayHello(name){
    return `Hello, ${name}`
}
